# 1. Ignore your raw photos (Keep your privacy)
wardrobe_dump/

# 2. Ignore the sorted wardrobe folders (Too large for Git)
my_wardrobe/

# 3. Ignore API Keys and Secrets
# If you eventually move your key to a separate file, ignore it here
.env
api_key.txt
secrets.json

# ⚠️ WARNING: 
# Since your API Key is currently hardcoded inside 'main_ui_final.py',
# DO NOT commit that file to a public repository unless you remove the key first!
# If you want to commit the code, replace the key in the file with "YOUR_KEY_HERE"
